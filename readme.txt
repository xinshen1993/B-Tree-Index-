Important information: \
(1)I used one extra page to store the treeheight and rootid.\
\
(2)In my Index Initial part, Professor Cho agreed  to initial with one root node and two leaf nodes. Might have some influences ( read one more page than optimal) when table is pretty small. \
\
(3)It reads several more pages when table is very small. I tried my best to figure out what happens, but no results. I think it is because of the initial structure. Some extra computer memory operations happened itself where I am not familiar with.\
\
(4)I use <algorithm> in SqlEngine.h which is just used to imply std:find to assist my implement. }
